# JavaScript Features Description Anastasiia Kozlenko Resume Web Site

Here you can find a list of functionalities in JavaScript on my website, described from top to bottom:

- **helloType.js**: A script in jQuery that types "HELLO" letter by letter.
- **sparklings.js**: A jQuery script that generates purple and pink sparkling images in random places. The speed adjusts based on mouse movement.
- **rotateGirl.js**: A vanilla JavaScript script that rotates parts of the main image based on mouse position.
- **blinkText.js**: A vanilla JavaScript script that creates a blinking effect for the text "YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYEE IS JUST HERE."
- **bounceArrow.js**: A vanilla JavaScript script that changes the Y position of an arrow to create a bouncing effect.
- **scrollClick.js**: A jQuery script that smoothly scrolls the page to the main resume section when the blinking text is clicked.
- **scrollSections.js**: A script using the ScrollReveal.js library to create a beautiful, smooth loading effect for resume sections.

I aimed to enhance the user experience by adding interactivity and joyful elements to the resume, reflecting my optimistic character !
